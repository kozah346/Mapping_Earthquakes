# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. In addition, the data is going to be visualized to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on earth and greater interest on earthquakes with a magnitude that is greater than 4.5 on the map and an additional map.
